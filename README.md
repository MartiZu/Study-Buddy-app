 ## Introduction

Here is the team project I did on week 8 of The School of Code Bootcamp! Team work was essential to create this great app and I am so amazed by what we were able to build in 4 days. 
We were asked to reflect on what fellow bootcampers need during the Bootcamp to supprot them and provide a solution to a problem. As a team we all shared what problems we encountered, we then dot voted and identified a problem we wanted to tackle as a team. The sense of isolation bootcamper experience while studying remotely and the need to upskill.

### How to use
1. After you clone the repo you will need to write in your terminal "npm i" to install all packages.
2. You will need to create a .env file and create a variable DB_CONNECTION_STRING. Give it value of your database connection string.
3. In the same .env file you will also need to create a variable PORT and assign it a value that you want.
4. Now write in your terminal "npm run dev" and open the login page using your localhost port number.

## Planning phase
We spent the first 2 days doing research and planning. We used Figma to build a low and high fidelity wireframe, we conducted research interviews and collected data using a questionnaire. All the data collected was used to create 2 user personas and build users stories. That's how our idea started to become something more concrete. We used Disney ideation to focus on what we would have actually been able to build in the time frame we had and with the set of skills we had. Ultimately we defined an MVP and extra features that we would have loved to build, but that we might not have time to do during the project week.

## Coding phase
When we started coding our goal was to build an app to help our fellow bootcampers to have a place where they can meet with each other in the evenings or weekends. This platform is design to provide meeting rooms where users can join and discuss about a specific topic, ask for help, learn from each other and share skills. 
We have also added a library of resources divided by topic so users have access to resources that other users have found useful, allowing to created a structured library that supports learning. 

At the end of the project we were able to create a register/login page, hasing and salting the password in our database. The users were able to use the resources and add resources.

## Future work: 
1.	Create a feature to allow users to request a meeting, or set a meeting for others to join.
2.	Implement our API to allow users to delete and modify the learning resources.
3.	Allow users to set a scoring on their skills so that the user can match with other users who would be able to offer support with specific skills.
4.	Create smaller meeting rooms (e.g. with a max of 5partecipant) where users can join until the room is full.
